## Updating your pull request

Sometimes a maintainer will ask you to edit your pull request before it's included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your pull request didn't match the guidelines. [Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write-up on how to update your pull request.
